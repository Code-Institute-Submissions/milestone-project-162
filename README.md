Memory Game-

How naughty is your memory?

A fun website to play a pinup themed memory game on 3 levels. The website features a starting page with a black and white background gif and a play button. 
Then the user is led to a easy level memory game with 9 cards. When succesfull, the medium level (16 cards) appears. At succesfull completion the difficoult 
level appears with 32 cards. 

The desired level is adjustable in the menu bar. There is also a possibility to share the site and to see your score.
This site is more attractive then the average online memory game and therefore has potential to entertain the visitors.

The goal of the site is to entertain, the goal of the visitor is to be entertained.
